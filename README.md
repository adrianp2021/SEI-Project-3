## Brief

This was a group project where we had to create a Full Stack React app using Node.js, Express and MondoDB.

Consume the data from the API with a frontend built with React

Use an Express API which would serve data from a Mongo database

Build the frontend and backend from scratch which means multiple relationships between models were created

Have an eye-catching design.

Be deployed online

Timeframe: 9 days
