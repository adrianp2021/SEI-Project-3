# General Assembly - SEI-Project-3

## Overview

My third project for the Software Engineering Immersive course, a complex MERN stack app.

## Project members

- [Richard Knight](https://github.com/RichardKnight88)
- [Vanja Tominc](https://github.com/VaniaTominc)

The app has been deployed with Heroku and is available [here](https://whispering-coast-70189.herokuapp.com/). 

## Brief

* This was a group project where we had to create a Full Stack React app using Node.js, Express and MongoDB.

* Consume the data from the API with a frontend built with React

* Use an Express API which would serve data from a Mongo database

* Build the frontend and backend from scratch and create multiple relationships between models

* Have an eye-catching design.

* Be deployed online

* Timeframe: 9 days

## Technologies used

- Node.js
- Express
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- Git + GitHub
- React
- JavaScript
- Semantic UI React
- Axios
- Bulma
- JWT
- Bcrypt
- Sass

## Pilis Trust

Full-Stack MERN app, we created a Greek mythology app based on [Trustpilot](https://www.trustpilot.com/), where either gods or standard users could register/login, and leave reviews based on their individual experience. Everyone worked on their assigned tasks, but styling and working on the landing/about page, register and login functionality was my focus.

## Planning

Following the briefing on the project, we started brainstorming various ideas about what our app will entail. The ideas have all been different initially but we all found common grounds within the Greek mythology. We decided to set up Pilis Trust, an app where users can review their other peers. In addition, we created the ability to register as a standard user and as a Deus user (the latter relates to gods). In order to ensure a smooth process, we used the agile methodology throughout; we set up a Trello board so everyone had access to each assigned task and keep track of each other's progress. Since we've been working remotely, Slack has been at the heart of the project, which ensured a fluid communication.

We all agreed to participate in the *backend* process so that we could all grasp the core of our application. An elected student would code every day, while the other two watched (with a few episodes of pair-coding). Upon completion of the backend, we would then assign the tasks accordingly on the *frontent*.


## Functionality

* Register & login

* Separate page for creating gods, i.e., Deus register

* Ability to search gods, or by categories

* Ability to add, edit or delete comments

* Scrolling comments on the homepage

* Functionality to populate url depending on the sex, e.g., thea for female, theo for male

* Modals for the TheoiScore, how to write a useful review

* From the UI perspective, ability to see the god by name rather than by id

## Assigning the workload

As this the first major project as a team, assessing the workload inherent has been paramount to our approach; we all took advantage of this opportunity to solidify some of the technical notions and improved them. With regards to more complex tasks, we elected a collective approach, where all of us would centralise the efforts, so we could fully grasp and overcome the technical challenge together. This has been a common practice during the backend development, whereas the frontend allowed for more flexibility. Teamwork has been central to precluding the technical obstacles and allowed a faster and efficient way of finishing the product within the timeframe provided. As for my input, I was responsible for the landing page, the about page, as well as the pages/functionalities for registering and signing in and the overall styling.


## Bugs

Any user can write a comment without being logged in.

## Wins and challenges

Setting up the backend proved trickier initially, however, the momentum built and improved throughout the project. In addition, as this was the first time using Git within a team, we had to do it together to avoid merge conflicts. Communication has been crucial to this.

## Future features

I would have liked to use anime.js for the application, to make it more user-interactive.

## Key learnings

Working in a team has been the most beneficial element but there were also challenges. Keeping good communication deferred us from running into big technical issues and allowed for a smooth developing process.
